- [x] Refactor mobile Expo analytics hooks to consume new backend summaries instead of legacy `getMetrics`
- [x] Update Convex agent tools/actions to use aggregated queries (dashboard summary, orders analytics, platform metrics)
- [x] Remove legacy raw dataset queries and ensure all consumers use the new summary endpoints
- [x] Overview refactor: consolidated Convex overview query now supplies metrics, platform stats, and channel revenue in one websocket, replacing multiple subscriptions that previously exceeded read limits.
- [x] Dashboard overview UI now consumes the unified hook, eliminating redundant aggregator hooks and the sync banner while using one real-time source of truth.
- [x] **Metric accuracy parity check** â€“ validate each card/widget against source Convex data across the overview (Units Sold, Orders, customer counts, operating cost metrics, Shopify revenue fields). Adjusted backend aggregations to align with Convex data.
- [x] Validate analytics flows across web, mobile, and agent surfaces after refactor.
- [x] Audit onboarding routes under `apps/web/app/(protected)/onboarding` (accounts, shopify, products, marketing, cost, billing, complete) to consolidate data fetching and drop legacy sync flags (no outstanding legacy calls found).
- [x] Refactor dashboard analytics routes (`apps/web/app/(protected)/(dashboard)/(analytics)/**`) to consume the new aggregated Convex endpoints instead of per-metric queries (verified hooks already use aggregated queries).
- [x] Update dashboard feature routes (`apps/web/app/(protected)/(dashboard)/(features)/**`) to reuse shared analytics hooks where possible (confirmed shared hook usage).
- [x] Simplify remaining dashboard hooks (e.g. `apps/web/hooks/mainapp/useOrdersAnalytics.ts`, `usePnLAnalytics.ts`) to leverage `getOverviewData`/related summaries and remove redundant aggregations (reviewed and aligned).
- [x] Review MCP and agent tools (`apps/backend/convex/agent/tools.ts`, `apps/backend/convex/agent/mcpActions.ts`) to ensure they call the consolidated overview/platform metrics queries.

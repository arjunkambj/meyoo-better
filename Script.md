# Meyoo Hackathon Video Script (4-5 minutes)
**Simple screen recording with voiceover - easy to edit**

---

## Intro (20 seconds)
**[Screen recording: Multiple browser tabs open - Shopify, Meta Ads, Google Sheets]**

🎙️: "Welcome to Meyoo. The one dashboard that shows you exactly how much money your online store is really making.

**[Transition to Meyoo dashboard]**

All your Shopify sales, Facebook ads, product costs, and expenses - finally in one place. See your real profit, not just revenue."

---

## Onboarding Flow (1 minute)
**[Screen recording: Meyoo onboarding page]**

🎙️: "Getting started with Meyoo takes just 3 minutes. Let me show you.

**[Click "Connect Shopify"]**

First, connect your Shopify store. One click, log in with your Shopify account, and done. Meyoo instantly pulls in your products, orders, and customers. Plus your last 60 days of sales history. Everything's already here, ready to go."

**[Show data importing]**

🎙️: "Choose your plan. We give you 14 days free to try everything. No credit card needed."

**[Click through billing]**

🎙️: "Now, connect your Facebook ads if you run them. This shows you which ads actually make you money versus which ones just get clicks."

**[Show Meta connection]**

🎙️: "Here's where it gets real - add what your products actually cost you. That t-shirt you sell for $30? If it costs you $12 to make, add that here. Meyoo will calculate your real profit on every sale."

**[Show cost input form]**

🎙️: "Add your other costs too. Shipping fees. Credit card processing. Your monthly expenses like software and staff. All those hidden costs that eat into your profit."

**[Show costs being added]**

🎙️: "And that's it! Your entire business is now in Meyoo. We're already calculating your real profit from the past 60 days. No more guessing."

## Dashboard Overview (1.5 minutes)
**[Screen recording: Main dashboard view]**

🎙️: "This is your new command center. Everything you need to know about your business, on one screen.

**[Hover over metrics]**

At the top - the numbers that matter most. Your actual profit after all expenses. Your total sales. Your profit margin. This is what you wake up to check every morning.

Below that - how many orders you got, your average order value, how much you spent on ads, what percentage of customers came back. Real insights, not vanity metrics.

But here's my favorite part..."

**[Click into P&L view]**

🎙️: "Your profit breakdown. You made $50,000 in sales. Great! But after returns, product costs, shipping, ads, and fees - your actual profit is $8,000. Now you know exactly where your money goes.

See this? You're spending $9,000 on shipping. That's way too high. Most stores spend half that. There's money you're leaving on the table."

**[Navigate to Analytics]**

🎙️: "Meyoo tracks over 100 different metrics. Customer behavior, inventory levels, marketing performance. Everything updates automatically."

**[Show inventory alerts]**

🎙️: "Look - your bestselling product only has 12 days of stock left. Time to reorder before you run out and lose sales."

**[Show customer cohorts]**

🎙️: "And this is gold - customers who bought in November spend 40% more than other months. Whatever you did in November, do it again."

**[Back to main dashboard]**

🎙️: "Best part? You can arrange everything how you want. Drag, drop, customize. Make it yours."

## AI Assistant (1 minute)
**[Screen recording: Agent sidebar opening]**

🎙️: "Meet your new business partner - Meyoo's AI assistant. It's like having a data expert on your team, but it never sleeps.

**[Type: "What was my profit last week?"]**

Just type your question. 'What was my profit last week?'"

**[Agent responds with answer]**

🎙️: "Boom. Instant answer. $3,400 profit, up 12% from the week before.

**[Type: "Which products need restocking?"]**

'Which products need restocking?'"

**[Agent lists products]**

🎙️: "It tells you exactly what's running low and when you'll run out.

**[Type: "Why are my profits down this month?"]**

Here's a real one - 'Why are my profits down this month?'"

**[Agent shows analysis]**

🎙️: "It actually analyzes your data and tells you - higher shipping costs and increased refunds are eating your margins. That's powerful.

**[Type: "Write an email about Black Friday results"]**

It can even write emails using your real numbers. Perfect for investor updates or team reports."

**[Agent drafts email]**

🎙️: "This isn't just a chatbot. It's an advisor that knows your business inside and out."

## MCP Integration (45 seconds)
**[Screen recording: MCP settings page]**

🎙️: "Here's something cool for the tech-savvy folks. Meyoo works with other AI tools too.

**[Show API key generation]**

**[Show Claude Desktop with Meyoo]**

**[Show ChatGPT integration]**

## Mobile App (30 seconds)
**[Screen recording: Phone screen or mobile simulator]**

🎙️: "Of course there's a mobile app. Check your profits from anywhere. Chat with your AI assistant on the go. Get alerts when inventory runs low or sales spike.

**[Scroll through mobile screens]**

At your kid's soccer game? Check how your Saturday sale is doing. In line at Starbucks? See which ads are working. 3 AM and can't sleep? Your profit margin is right there.

Your entire business, in your pocket."
